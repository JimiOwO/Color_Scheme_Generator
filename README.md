# Color_Scheme_Generator
A final project for RPI's Interactive Visualization course

In human history, there are numerous art works that utilize color to capture imaginations.
We believe we can find the color palette used in all paintings. Thus, for our final project, we aim to research the artwork’s color scheme with computer visualization.
Potential audiences for this application and visualization are various, including but not limited to, art researchers aiming to analyze color choices in art history, museum curators writing additional caption information, or just content creators gathering inspiration from older arts.
The core story board for this project is mainly asking users for an image of artwork as an input, and then output 5 colors used in the image. We also wanted to make this application interactive and easy to use. For example, this application will synthesize the five color pallets next to the image, to better show the connection between color and artwork; the application will parameterize the number of colors to be selected, and thus give more colors; the application will analyze if the input image is monochrome... etc.

We want to divide this project into 3 stages, as for 3 progress post:
1. Core function design: develop the main structure and algorithm of selecting the main
colors scheme in the input artwork. This part is the most important/hard part.
2. UI design: Make this application “interactive” with users synthesizing the palette and the
artwork.
3. Debugging, peripheral features: Test the project application with different choices of
artwork in history, add peripheral features such as input checking and parameterizing some options. Finish the document.
While we are still working on the division of the labor, we would tentatively divide the
work into algorithms and applications. Such that we can start working parallelly for better efficiency.
We haven’t foreseen many risks and limitations in this project. One consideration needed is the copyright of some artwork. We will pay extreme attention when synthesizing the artwork
and will also consider adding reference information to the final result(artist, name, year, medium, collector). The other thing is that we might not be able to find a “good enough algorithm” that can precisely summarize and pick the color. However, there exist many algorithms on both the Internet and in journals that can analyze dominant color, which can be a great jump board. We can start by looking and experimenting with those algorithms and pick one that works the best, then do modification on it.
